# Competitive Coding Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges on HackerRank, including:

- Account Transactions
- Data Finder
- Joined Logger
- Notes Store
- Order List Processing

Each challenge has its own directory with a `soln.js` file containing the solution code.

Note: This repository is for educational purposes only and should not be used to cheat on coding challenges or assessments.
